  - App menu:
      - option to show tutorial
      - option to reset current puzzle (confirm!)
      - option to switch between rect/hex game
  - "Replay tutorial" and "Replay puzzle" buttons should ask to reset pieces
  - Tutorial page(s) that you can swipe through.
  - Allow BaseGridView to take up more space (especially useful in horizontal mode):
        - Hide app bar / replace with a floating button?
        - Fullscreen mode? (Always on, or optional?)
          https://developer.android.com/training/system-ui/immersive
  - Option to rotate hex grid by 60 degrees?
  - Better launcher icon
  - Maybe: rename to avoid spoilers? (But include a link / give some credits!)

Cleanup:
  - Maybe: precalculate overlap-errors and pass them in to the drawer to save time during draw?
  - Maybe: figure out how to obtain AndroidViewModel in fragments, instead of creating a static singleton in the App class.
  - Maybe: use SavedStateHandle to persist AppState instead of SharedPreferences?
    (Would require making ImmutableList and Pos Serializable/Parcelable?)

Stretch goals:
  - Undo function
  - Ability to load/save states?
  - Auto-save e.g. 15 seconds after a change is made (requires refactoring AppState)
  - Dragging a piece to the side should scroll the view
  - Fancy fragment transition animations
  - Light/dark mode
  - Ability to name & upload your solution
  - Google Analytics

Non-goals:
  - Haptic feedback when selecting pieces. (I implemented it but I didn't like how it felt.)
