  - AppState: allow overriding state with intent (as with RectPuzzleActivity and HexPuzzleActivity)
  - Better launcher icon
  - Tutorial page(s) that you can swipe through.
    This puzzle has only three simple rules:
    (1) "Paths" must connect
    (2) "Backsides" must not touch/overlap
    (3) Connect all pieces into a single group
    Hint: don't create loops?
    Hint: you can pinch to zoom, drag to pan, long-press to move a group
  - App menu:
      - option to show tutorial
      - option to reset current puzzle (confirm!)
      - option to switch between rect/hex game
  - Victory animation after solving!
      - solving rect puzzle should get you towards hex puzzle
      - solving hex puzzle should allow you to reset it

Cleanup:
  - Remove old HexPuzzleActivity and RectPuzzleActivity
  - Remove old SharedPreferences
  - Maybe: precalculate overlap-errors and pass them in to the drawer to save time during draw?
  - Maybe: separate rectangular pieces into fore- and background, and make selection invert background only (as is done for hexagonal pieces)

Stretch goals:
  - Fancy fragment transition animations
  - Light/dark mode
  - Ability to name & upload your solution
