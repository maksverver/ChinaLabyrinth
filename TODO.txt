  - Take some screenshots: rules, rect puzzle solved, hex puzzle in progress
  - Auto-save e.g. 15 seconds after a change is made
  - Maybe: rename to avoid spoilers? (But include a link / give some credits!)

Cleanup:
  - Maybe: use SavedStateHandle to persist AppState instead of SharedPreferences?
    (Would require making ImmutableList and Pos Serializable/Parcelable?)

Stretch goals:
  - Floating button to show context menu (instead of on App Bar)
  - Option to rotate hex grid by 90 degrees?
    Or just rotate the grid by default, so that the hexagons have a diagonal pointing
    straight up, which makes it easier to construct symmetric solution in portrait
    orientation.
  - Dragging a piece to the side should scroll the view
  - Undo function?
  - Ability to load/save states?
  - Ability to name & upload your solution?
  - Google Analytics

Non-goals:
  - Haptic feedback when selecting pieces. (I implemented it but I didn't like how it felt.)
  - Light theme. Decided it's not worth the effort.
